# Machine Learning Model API

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to develop a machine learning model, serve it via an API using Flask, and integrate it with a PostgreSQL database. The goal is to provide a comprehensive solution for deploying machine learning models in a production-like environment.

## Steps Completed

1. **Model Development**  
   Developed a machine learning model based on a dataset of choice.  
   - Example models include
     - House price prediction using regression techniques.
     - Sentiment analysis using NLP techniques.

2. **Dockerize the API**  
   Created a simple Flask (or FastAPI) application to serve the trained model via an API.  
   - Wrote a Dockerfile to containerize the application, ensuring all dependencies (like Python, Flask, etc.) are included.

3. **Database Integration**  
   Integrated a PostgreSQL database to store logs, model metadata, or user data.  
   - Containerized the database to ensure smooth communication with the API.
