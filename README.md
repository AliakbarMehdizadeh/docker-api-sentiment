# Project: Scalable Machine Learning API with Docker and Kubernetes

## Goal
Build a machine learning model (e.g., a recommendation system, sentiment analysis model, or a regression model) and deploy it as a REST API using Docker. Then, use Kubernetes (or Docker Swarm) to orchestrate and scale the API across multiple containers, ensuring it can handle large-scale requests efficiently.

## Key Steps

### 1. Model Development
- Choose a machine learning model based on a dataset you are comfortable with. For instance:
  - House price prediction model using regression
  - Sentiment analysis using NLP techniques

### 2. Dockerize the API
- Create a simple Flask or FastAPI application to serve the trained model via an API.
- Write a `Dockerfile` to containerize the entire application (including dependencies like Python, Flask, etc.).

### 3. Database Integration
- Use a PostgreSQL or any other database for storing logs, model metadata, or user data.
- Containerize the database to ensure it works smoothly with your API.

### 4. Orchestrate with Kubernetes (or Docker Swarm)
- Write Kubernetes configuration files (`deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`, etc.) to define the deployment and scaling rules for your API.
- Use Kubernetes to scale your application across multiple containers, ensuring fault tolerance and load balancing.

### 5. Monitoring and Logging
- Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana to track the performance of the model and infrastructure.
- Use ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline
- Use Docker Hub to automatically push the Docker images after committing the code.
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate the deployment of your containerized API.

## Tools
- **Docker**: For containerizing the machine learning API and database.
- **Kubernetes/Docker Swarm**: For orchestration and scaling.
- **Flask/FastAPI**: To build the API.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: For database management.
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: For monitoring performance.
- **GitHub Actions/Jenkins**: For CI/CD pipeline automation.

## Conclusion
This project will help you master Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration, essential skills for deploying scalable data science solutions.
